    # Assuming the backend is in a sibling directory or you have the image
    # For this resume project, we'll assume the user runs backend locally or we point to the image if they have one.
    # Since I don't have the backend code here (it's a separate repo usually, or mixed), 
    # I will comment this out or use a placeholder image if I knew it.
    # But wait, the user said "This project is the backend service..." in README_backend.md?
    # Ah, the file structure shows `src` which looks like React.
    # The `README_backend.md` implies there IS a backend.
    # Let's assume the backend is running on host or is a separate service.
    # I'll just put the frontend here for now, or add a placeholder for backend.
